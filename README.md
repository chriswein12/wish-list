# 12Wishes

## Description of the Website
This website is designed to create and share wishlists with friends, family or groups. 
Users are able to create their wishlist and send a unique link to specific people who are able to view items the original user has added to their wishlist. 

<br/>

## How it Works
* The user first signs up for an account that allows them access to their own dashboard. The dashboard will show any and all wishlists they have created.
* Next, the user selects the button to create and then name a new wishlist.
* The user then is able to fill out a form to add items to the wishlist, with the option of name, price, location with optional description and url link to item. 
* After, the user is able to send their wishlist to other member in the group they are requesting gifts from using the "Share" button which will generate a url link that can be copied for use in email or messengers. 
* When using the unique link, friends and family can view the wishlist without the need to sign up/log in.  
* Friends and family will not have the same options provided to the user who created the list for deleting, sharing, etc. They will only be able to view the list, not edit.

## Website Features
* Mobile Responsiveness
    * Each screen size has been tested to verify that the app is friendy and easy to use with all devices.
* Users have the ability to create and maintain multiple wishlists. 
* Shared wishlists are viewable without creating an account.  
* Session data is used to determine who is signed in causing wishlists visuals to display differently based off which user is viewing the wishlist.  
* Bycrypt is used to hash users password and create data security.  
* Error handling is implemented to reduce data breakdowns. Checks include:
    * Using form parameters to limit input data in form fields. 
    * Verifying email is valid on sign up.
    * Only allowing a logged in user to view their dashboard. Third parties cannot access a user's dashboard.
