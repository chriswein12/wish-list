# 12 Wishes

## Description of the Website
This website is designed to create and share wishlists among clients who are in a group. 
Users are able to create their wishlist and send to specific people who are able to view items the original client has asked for in gifts. Multiple people are able to view the wishlist and mark off items they have purchased without the creator of the wishlist knowing. 

<br/>

## How it Works
* The user first signs up for an account that allows them access to their own dashboard.
* Next, the user selects the button to create and then name a new wishlist.
* The user then is able to fill out a form to add items to the wishlist, with the option of name, price, location with optional description and url link to item. 
* After, the user is able to send their wishlist to other member in the group they are requesting gifts from. 
*When received, additional users can view the wishlist without the need to sign up/in.  
* Finally, when logged in, users who received the list have the ability to mark off items that were purchased.

## Website Features
* Mobile Responsiveness
    * Each screen size has been tested to verify that the app is friendy and easy to use with all devices.
* Users have the ability to create multiple wishlists for multiple events. 
* Shared wishlists are viewable without creating an account.  
* Session data is used to determine who is signed in causing wishlists visuals to display  differently based off which user is viewing the wishlist.  
* Bycrypt is used to hash users password and create data security.  
* Error handling is implemented to reduce data breakdowns. Checks include:
    * Using form parameters to limit input data in form fields. 
    * Verifying email is valid on sign up
    * Not allowing manual url navigation to a non user. 
    * All errors are handled by modals.
